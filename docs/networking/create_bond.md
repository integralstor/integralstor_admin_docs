**Bonding mode** : The UNICell system supports two modes of bonding â€“ 802.3ad(mode 4) or balance-alb (mode 6). Please note that 802.3ad needs support and configuration on the switch side as well.

**Slave interfaces** : Select the interfaces that you want to include as part of this bond. Only those interfaces that are not already a part of another bond will be displayed here.
