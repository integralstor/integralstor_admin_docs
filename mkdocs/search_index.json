Once the UNICell system is powered on, the system will boot up and you will see some messages on the monitor as the operating system and the storage software loads.\n\n\nAt the end of the booting sequence, you will see a menu of options on the monitor(Screen) similar to the screen shot below. Operations performed on this console menu will override any operations that may have been done from IntegralView so please use this menu with caution.\n\n\nConnect at least one ethernet port to your network before proceeding. Choose the \u201cConfigure networking\u201d option from the console menu.\n\n\nThis will take you through a few prompts for basic network configuration. Select the network settings for the ethernet port to which you have connected the cable. Please note that since it is advisable to use a static IP address for a storage device so that it can be accessible even across reboots.\n\n\nOnce you have configured your IP settings, you will then need to choose the \u201cScan system configuration\u201d menu option in order for the system to scan and generate the initial hardware configuration.\n\n\nOnce these two options have been completed, you are now ready to use IntegralView to perform all further operations.\n\n\nIt is now advisable to disconnect the keyboard and monitor to prevent unintended access to the console menu.",

For most common tasks, the admin username called \"admin\" should be used. The default password for this user is set to \u201cadmin\u201d.\n\n\nThere is another administrator login name called \"superadmin\" which gives provides all the functionality of the \"admin\" user plus the ability to remotely reboot the IntegralStor system.

            "text": "The IntegralStor UNICell system is based upon the ZFS filesystem. ZFS provides many features that combine to provide an extremely scalable and rock solid file system. Some of these features include extreme data integrity(protection against silent disk errors, etc using parity based checksumming), software RAID, read and write caching, copy-on-write, light weight snapshots, deduplication, compression and extreme scalability (it is a 128-bit file system that is capable of managing zettabytes (one billion terabytes) of data!).\n\n\nBefore you can start using your UNICell system, it is useful to be familiar with some of the terminology that is used in ZFS.\n\n\nPool\n - The basic building block that is required in order to use a UNICell system is a ZFS Pool. A pool is a logical group of devices describing the layout(RAID, mirror, stripe, etc) and physical characteristics of the available storage. Depending upon the number of underlying storage devices and the layouts, you could have more than one pool on a UNICell system. Pools have many familiar ZFS features, including copy-on-write, snapshots, clones, and checksumming. A pool is a prerequisite in order to create a ZFS filessystem or a block device volume.\nA pool can be in one of the following states : online (all well), degraded(when one or more underlying disks have failed but the pool is still accessible) or faulted(no longer usable as more than the minimum number of redundancy has been exceeded due to faulty disks).\n\n\nDataset\n - A dataset is a ZFS filesystem that is created on top of a pool. All end user file based data in the UNICell system has to reside in a ZFS dataset. You can turn on features such as compression or deduplication on a dataset.\n\n\nVolume\n - A volume is a block device that can be created within a pool. In order to create an ISCSI target, a volumes is a prerequisite. You can turn on features such as compression or deduplication on a volume as well.\n\n\nSnapshot\n - A read-only copy of a dataset(file system) or volume at a given point in time.\nSnapshots in ZFS are instantanous and light weight. The copy on write feature of ZFS means that the snapshot contains the original version of the filesystem or volume and the current(live) version of the volume or file system consists only of the changes since the last snapshot.\nSnapshots can be used to provide a readonly version of a filesystem or volume at a point in time or they can also be used to rollback to a certain point in time.\n\n\nWrite cache\n \u2013 A ZFS pool can be configured with a write cache. In the UNICell system can configure the main memory(RAM) to serve as an extremely fast write cache.\n\n\nScrub\n \u2013 Scrubbing a pool involves calculating the checksum of all the data blocks in the pool and comparing them against the correct checksum stored in the metadata. This is useful to check silent corruption of data. It is suggested that the pools are scrubbed every couple of months. Data access speeds are degraded when a scrub is being done so please schedule it at a time when the usage is low.",

Because of that, incremental file backups are really fast.\n\n\nYour files can be restored through the web interface, via the client or the Windows Explorer while the backups of drive volumes can be restored with a bootable CD or USB-Stick (bare metal restore).\n\n\nA web interface makes setting up your own backup server really easy. For a quick impression please look at the screenshots here.\n\n\nCurrently there are over 10,000 running UrBackup server instances (with auto-update enabled) with some instances having hundreds of active clients.\"\n\n\nUNICell has integrated the UrBackup admin interface into IntegralView.
